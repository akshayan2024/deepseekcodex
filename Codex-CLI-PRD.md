# OpenAI Codex CLI - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
Codex CLI is a lightweight coding agent that runs in the terminal, enabling developers to leverage AI capabilities directly from their command line. It allows developers to execute complex coding tasks, manipulate files, and interact with their repositories through natural language, all while maintaining security and user control.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Software developers who primarily work in terminal environments
- Developers looking to integrate AI assistance into their existing workflow
- Professionals who need quick code generation, explanation, or modification capabilities
- Engineers who prefer command-line interfaces over graphical ones

## 2. Features and Functionality

### 2.1 Core Features

#### 2.1.1 Interactive AI Command-Line Interface
- Terminal-based chat interface for interacting with AI
- Support for multi-turn conversations with context preservation
- Ability to execute commands, read/write files, and perform code operations

#### 2.1.2 Configurable Approval System
Three distinct operational modes:
- **Suggest Mode** (Default): AI can read files but requires approval for any writes or commands
- **Auto-Edit Mode**: AI can automatically apply file changes but requires approval for commands
- **Full-Auto Mode**: AI can automatically execute both file changes and commands in a sandbox environment

#### 2.1.3 Sandboxed Execution Environment
- Network-disabled sandbox for secure command execution
- Directory-confined operations to prevent unwanted file system manipulation
- Platform-specific security mechanisms (Apple Seatbelt on macOS, Docker container option for Linux)

#### 2.1.4 Git Integration
- Repository-aware operations 
- Version control safety checks
- Warning system for non-Git directories

#### 2.1.5 Multimodal Input Support
- Ability to process text-based prompts
- Support for image inputs (screenshots, diagrams) for visual context

### 2.2 User Experience Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Input and Interaction Methods
- Direct command-line arguments for quick usage
- Interactive REPL mode for extended sessions
- Support for multi-line input in the terminal
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

#### 2.2.2 Output Formatting
- Terminal-friendly output formatting
- Visual differentiation between system, user, and AI messages
- Clear indication of approval states and security levels
- Support for code syntax highlighting in responses

#### 2.2.3 Notification System
- Optional desktop notifications for completed operations
- Real-time progress indicators for long-running tasks

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 System Requirements
- **Operating Systems**: macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, Windows 11 (via WSL2)
- **Node.js**: Version 22 or newer
- **Git**: Version 2.23+ (optional but recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended

### 3.2 Security Requirements
- Sandbox isolation for command execution
- Network access disabled by default in Full-Auto mode
- Limited filesystem access to working directory and temporary files
- Optional additional writable roots configuration
- Git tracking warning system

### 3.3 Performance Requirements
- Responsive command-line interface with minimal lag
- Efficient token usage for extended conversations
- Memory management for long sessions
- Support for context summarization to reduce token usage

### 3.4 Compatibility Requirements
- Integration with standard terminal environments
- Shell completion support (bash, zsh, fish)
- Compatibility with CI/CD pipeline usage

## 4. Configuration and Customization

### 4.1 Configuration Options
- API key management via environment variables or .env file
- Model selection with command-line flags
- Approval mode selection at startup or runtime
- Custom writable directories specification
- Project-specific instructions via markdown files

### 4.2 Instructions System
- Global instructions file (`~/.codex/instructions.md`)
- Repository-level instructions (`codex.md` at repo root)
- Directory-specific instructions (`codex.md` in current working directory)

## 5. Command Reference

### 5.1 Basic Commands
- `codex`: Launch interactive REPL
- `codex "prompt"`: Execute with initial prompt
- `codex -q "prompt"`: Non-interactive quiet mode

- `--approval-mode/-a <mode>`: Set approval policy
- `--image/-i <path>`: Include image file as input
- `--writable-root/-w <path>`: Specify additional writable directories
- `--quiet/-q`: Enable non-interactive mode
- `--notify`: Enable desktop notifications
